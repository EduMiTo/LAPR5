### MBCO definition


 The Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO) corresponds to the definition of a minimum level of services that must be available during an incident, emergency or disaster, so the company can proceed with its vital activities.


### Framing with the business
 
 In this case, as ElectricGo is a company specializing in deliveries, we can define the MBCO so EletricGo continues to perform and manage deliveries.


### MBCO analysis

 Considering what was mentioned above, the services that must be always available are:
 * Users data, so no information is lost about all the users registered in the system and, thus, the workers can continue to use the application;
 * Deliveries management (create, list, update and delete) so the main activity of EletricGo can be performed normally, assuming that deliveries database is available too.
 
 With these 2 services assured, the company can continue with its main activities whether or not something unexpected happens.
